	<p>Figuring out how to use Git with Dreamweaver...</p>
	<p>Testing the pushing of index.html file to Github repository</p>
	<p>First time, could not connect to Github because Github no longer accepts passwords.  You need to generate a token.  Did that and now I am testing with using the token as the password in Dreamweaver.</p>
	<p>Trying again. And again. And again and again and again...</p>
	<p>...And again....</p>
<p>And again....</p>
	<p>One more time!</p>
	<p>Checking to make sure!</p>
